# NO EXTERNAL ROUTES
#
# External access is now handled by OAuth proxy routes in auth/oauth-routes.yaml
#
# This file is kept for future direct internal route definitions if needed.
#
# The cost monitor application is now accessed via:
# - Dashboard: via OAuth proxy (auth/oauth-routes.yaml)
# - Health checks: direct route with IP restrictions (auth/oauth-routes.yaml)
# - Data API: INTERNAL ONLY (no external routes)
#
# All user access goes through the OAuth-protected dashboard route.
